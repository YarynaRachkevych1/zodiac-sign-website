			Roll out the red carpet, because Leo has arrived. Leo is represented 
			by the lion, and these spirited fire signs are the kings and queens of the celestial jungle. 
			They're delighted to embrace their royal status: Vivacious, theatrical, and passionate, 
			Leos love to bask in the spotlight and celebrate themselves. These lions are natural leaders 
			and they enjoy cultivating friendships and romances that are artistically and creatively inspired. 
			Playful Leos have no problem leaning into drama-fueled romances that are perfectly suited for the tabloids. 
			(In fact, they may even prefer them.) After all, every Leo perceives him or herself as a celebrity. 
			These astrological divas never get tired of lavish dinners, exclusive parties, or decadent designer wear.
